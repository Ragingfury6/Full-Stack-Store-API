# Custom Task Manager

This is an admin portal for a store, with all CRUD operations supported for the products in the store. You are currently able to filer by product ID or product category.

## Starting the Application

- Run `git clone https://github.com/Ragingfury6/Full-Stack-Store-API.git` to clone the application
- Run `npm i` to install the dependencies
- Create a .env file setting `MONGO_URI` equal to your Mongo DB URI
- Run `npm start` in the terminal
- Open the index.html file in the public folder
- Enjoy!

## How to Use the Front End

- For filtering data, you can change the slider to filter either by category or ID
- While the ID is not displayed in the table, it is located in a data attribute in the html (you can also find it from Atlas online)
- Clicking the arrow next to the price tab will sort the data either by price ascending or descending
